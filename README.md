# Introduction
This repository includes program codes from Food Insecurity and Resilience in the United States study conducted by [Prof. Chris Barrett](http://barrett.dyson.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University.

## Study Description
Given the importance of food security, both globally and within the United States, we propose an exploration of the usefulness of a specific food security measurement tool used in developing countries as a complement to established measures used by the food security research community within the United States. The recently-developed Ciss√© and Barrett (C&B) method of resilience measurement is designed explicitly to measure wellbeing dynamics. This method is particularly useful in cases where we have multiple observations of households over time, such as in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The PSID has captured food security explicitly through the Household Food Security Module (HFSM) since 1997, though not continuously. The C&B method offers the potential to expand food security analysis into years prior to 1997, creating opportunities to study longer term dynamics and structural changes than the current HFSM measure allows.

## Primary Data
The study analyzes Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and Current Population Survey (CPS)
