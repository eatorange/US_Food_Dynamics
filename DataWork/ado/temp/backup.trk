d 'IETOOLKIT': module providing commands specially developed for Impact Evaluations
d 
d  ietookit provides a set of commands that address different
d aspects of data management and data analysis in relation to
d Impact Evaluations. The list of commands will be extended
d continuously, and suggestions on new commands are highly
d appreciated. Some of the commands are related to standardized
d practices developed at the World Bankâ€™s unit for Impact
d Evaluations (DIME) and might not apply to practices adopted at
d other institutions. For these commands, the corresponding help
d files provide justifications for the standardized practices
d applied. ieduplicates and iecompdup are useful tools to identify
d and correct for duplicates. iebaltab is a tool for multiple
d treatment arm balance tables. ieboilstart standardizes the
d boilerplate code at the top of all do-files. iegraph produces
d graphs based on common impact evaluation regression models. See
d https://github.com/worldbank/ietoolkit for more details.

d 'FTOOLS': module to provide alternatives to common Stata commands optimized for large datasets
d 
d  ftools consists of a Mata file and several Stata commands: The
d Mata file creates identifiers (factors) from variables by using
d hash functions instead of sorting the data, so it runs in time
d O(N) and not in O(N log N). The Stata commands exploit this to
d avoid sort operations,  at the cost of being slower for small
d datasets (mainly because of the cost involved in moving data from
d Stata to Mata). Implemented commands are fcollapse, fegen group,
d and fsort. Note that most of the capabilities of levels and
d contract are already supported by these commands. Possible
d commands include more egen functions and merge and reshape
d alternatives.

d 
d This ado-file provides the Gini coefficient for the whole

d Pyatt's (1976)  decomposition in between-, overlap- and
d within-group inequality. Groupvar is a categorical variable (not
d string) who determines the subgroups in which the population will
d be divided. It's mandatory that the command ineqdeco (S. P.
d Jenkins, 1998) has been  installed. A link is provided to that

d 
d ineqdeco estimates a range of inequality and related
d indices      commonly  used by economists, plus optional
d decompositions of a subset of      these indices by  population
d subgroup.  Indices estimated are:   members of the single

d 2; the Atkinson class A(e) for e = 0.5, 1, 2;       the Gini
d coefficient, and the percentile ratios p90/p10 and p75/p25.
d Optionally presented are indices  related to the Atkinson
d inequality indices, viz equally-distributed-equivalent income
d  Yede(e), social welfare indices W(e), and the Sen welfare index.
d      If there are observations with negative or zero values on
d the variable     of interest, and you wish to wish to estimate
d inequality indices    including these observations, then use
d ineqdec0 (q.v.)      This version is for Stata versions 8.2
d onwards. For versions 5 to 8.1,      use ineqdeco5 instead.

d 'LASSOPACK': module for lasso, square-root lasso, elastic net, ridge, adaptive lasso estimation and cross-validation
d 
d  LASSOPACK is a suite of programs for penalized regression
d methods suitable for the high-dimensional setting where the
d number of predictors p may be large and possibly greater than the
d number of observations. LASSOPACK supports both lasso and
d logistic lasso regression. The package consists of six main
d programs: lasso2 implements lasso, square-root lasso, elastic
d net, ridge regression, adaptive lasso and post-estimation OLS.
d cvlasso supports K-fold cross-validation and rolling
d cross-validation for cross-section, panel and time-series data.
d rlasso implements theory-driven penalization for the lasso and
d square-root lasso for cross-section and panel data. lassologit,
d cvlassologit and rlassologit are the corresponding programs for
d logistic lasso regression. The lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage
d and Selection Operator, Tibshirani 1996), the square-root-lasso
d (Belloni et al. 2011) and the adaptive lasso (Zou 2006) are
d regularization methods that use L1 norm penalization to achieve
d sparse solutions: of the full set of p predictors, typically most
d will have coefficients set to zero. Ridge regression (Hoerl &
d Kennard 1970) relies on L2 norm penalization; the elastic net
d (Zou & Hastie 2005) uses a mix of L1 and L2 penalization. lasso2
d implements all these estimators. rlasso uses the theory-driven
d penalization methodology of Belloni et al. (2012, 2013, 2014,
d 2016) for the lasso and square-root lasso. cvlasso implements
d K-fold cross-validation and h-step ahead rolling cross-validation
d (for time-series and panel data) to choose the penalization
d parameters for all the implemented estimators. lassologit,
d rlassologit and cvlassologit extend support to the case where the
d dependent variable is a binary response. In addition, rlasso
d implements the Chernozhukov et al. (2013) sup-score test of joint
d significance of the regressors that is suitable for the
d high-dimensional setting.

d (2012). Following Barros et al. (2006), this method takes
d advantage of the additivity property of a welfare aggregate to

d calculate their contribution to the observed changes in poverty,
d inequality and the growth incidence curve. This method can be

d will change as discussed by Azevedo, Sanfelice and Nguyen (2012). d
