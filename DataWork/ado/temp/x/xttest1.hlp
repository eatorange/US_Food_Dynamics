You must {cmd:tsset} your data before using {cmd:xttest1}; see {manhelp tsset TS}.


{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
{cmd:xttest1} offers several specification tests for error-component
models. It includes the Breusch and Pagan (1980) Lagrange multiplier test for
random effects; the Baltagi-Li (1995) test for first-order serial correlation;
the Baltagi-Li (1991) joint test for serial correlation and random effects; and
the family of robust tests in Bera, Sosa-Escudero, and Yoon (2001).
{cmd:xttest1} is an extension of {cmd:xttest0}. The procedure
handles unbalanced panels as long as there are no "gaps" in the series; that
is, individual time series may differ in their start and end period but cannot
have missing values in intermediate periods.

{p 4 4 2}
If you have not read {manhelp tsset TS}, please do so now. Consider the
standard-error component model allowing for possible first-order serial
correlation:

		y[i,t] = a + B*x[i,t] + u[i] + e[i,t]

		e[i,t] = rho e[i,t-1] + v[i,t]

{p 4 4 2}
Typically, researchers are interested in the hypothesis of no random effects
(Var(u[i])=0), no serial correlation (rho=0), or both. After fitting a balanced
random-effects model using {cmd:xtreg, re}, {cmd:xttest0} produces seven
specification tests:

{phang2}1) LM test for random effects, assuming no serial correlation{p_end}
{phang2}2) Adjusted LM test for random effects, which works even under
             serial correlation{p_end}
{phang2}3) One-sided version of the LM test for random effects{p_end}
{phang2}4) One-sided version of the adjusted LM test for random effects{p_end}
{phang2}5) LM joint test for random effects and serial correlation{p_end}
{phang2}6) LM test for first-order serial correlation, assuming no
             random effects{p_end}
{phang2}7) Adjusted test for first-order serial correlation, which works
             even under random effects{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}
Tests 1, 2, 6, and 7 have asymptotic chi-squared distribution with one degree
of freedom under the null hypothesis. Test 5 has asymptotic chi-squared
distribution with two degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis, and tests 3
and 4 have standard normal distribution under the null.


{title:Option}

{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:unadjusted} shows all -- unadjusted, adjusted, and joint -- test
statistics.  The default output shows the adjusted and joint test statistics.
